## Galactic Trader: ##
In this game, the player becomes a space trader, traveling between planets to buy low and sell high. The player must manage their ship, cargo, and finances while avoiding pirates and other dangers.
Key components:
- Procedurally generated galaxy map with various planets, trade routes, and events
- Trading system with dynamic market prices influenced by supply and demand
- Ship upgrades and customization options
- Combat encounters with pirates and other hostile entities
- Random events and encounters that can affect the player's journey

--------------------------------------------------------------
**Here's how "Galactic Trader" can fulfill the project requirements:**

1. Generation of random game sets or events:
Generate a procedurally created galaxy map with various planets, trade routes, and events.
Randomize the market prices for goods on different planets, influenced by supply and demand.
Implement random events and encounters, such as pirate attacks, distress signals, or special trade opportunities.

2. Data structures for storing game status:
Use structs to represent the player's ship, planets, goods, and market prices.
Implement a graph or adjacency matrix to represent the galaxy map and connections between planets.
Use arrays or linked lists to manage the player's cargo and inventory.

3. Dynamic memory management:
Use pointers and dynamic memory allocation to create and manage game objects, such as planets, goods, and market prices.
Implement functions to add, remove, or modify game objects as needed.

4. File input/output:
Implement functions to save the game state, including the player's progress, cargo, credits, and the state of the galaxy.
Allow the player to load a saved game and resume playing from where they left off.

5. Program codes in multiple files:
Organize the code into multiple source files (e.g., main.c, galaxy.c, ship.c, market.c, etc.) and header files (e.g., galaxy.h, ship.h, market.h, etc.).

6. Proper indentation and naming styles:
Follow a consistent coding style and conventions throughout the project, such as indentation, variable naming, and function naming.
In-code documentation:

7. Include comments and descriptions for functions, variables, and other important elements.
In "Galactic Trader," the player will navigate a vast and ever-changing galaxy, making strategic decisions to maximize their profits and survive the dangers of space. The project will showcase your skills in C/C++ programming, data structures, dynamic memory management, and file handling, while also demonstrating your ability to design and implement an engaging and strategic text-based game.
